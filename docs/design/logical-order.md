# Conditional logical order

`pipeline_typing.logical_order` retains a deterministic sequence established by a
checked time-series or Calendar-series generator. Language explicitly orders
these outputs by ascending time/start. The opaque summary retains the originating
step and the immediate preserving input edge; callers cannot construct one from
a `total: true` flag. Inspect it in its originating pipeline, which retains all
intermediate steps, bindings, profiles and validation/resource obligations.

This is a conditional successful-execution law, not an observed order, a runnable
Plan certificate or a proof that a Connector returned complete data. A generator
with unbound Parameters still requires successful binding and validation. An
empty generated sequence retains the same law and does not waive those checks.

Filter, derive, select, rename, drop, take, assertions, lag, watermark_rows and
Calendar bucket preserve an existing sequence. Empty sort preserves it without
candidate-key completion. Transfer follows the resolved input edge, including
branches, rather than whichever step happened to precede it in source order.
Projection may remove the original ordering field without changing occurrence
order: this does not make a remaining constant field a candidate key. Logical
order and candidate keys are deliberately separate evidence.

External inputs have no implicit order. Nonempty sort is not considered resolved
merely because its keys type-check; its completion/tie evidence needs a separate
boundary. Other unimplemented transfer rules return no summary rather than an
invented unordered value or an unconditional success. Results still retain their
publication-order obligation. Connecting completed authored orders, candidate-key
completion, other ordered operations, validated external witnesses and Results
publication remains shared-evidence work.

The pass is nonrecursive and charges one work unit per checked step. It shares
the generator and records immediate edges without copying an ever-growing path.
The Relation transfer classifier reads private checked metadata in constant time,
including empty-sort detection, without copying order arrays. Fixed Sketch
`87dc7144` uses the same operation-origin versus preserved-order distinction
(`operationOrdering` / `preservedOrdering`); its public booleans are not adopted
as an admission API here. The normative generator and empty-sort rules, not a
backend's observed row order, justify these summaries.
