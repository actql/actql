# Development

## Setup and verification

With Node.js 22 or newer and Python 3.10 or newer:

```sh
npm ci
npm run check:docs
```

Node.js is used for documentation tooling. Product implementation is developed
in MoonBit; see the [implementation guide](design/implementation-port.md).

The checks are read-only:

- `check:contracts`: contract pins, requirement ownership and generated registry freshness.
- `check:links`: Markdown local files and anchors, plus JSON syntax.
- `check:examples`: YAML Program fixtures, valid-example root layout, example registration and acceptance-case references.
- `test:docs`: validator regression tests.
- `check:nest`: independent Python lowering and JavaScript identity-preimage checks for the authored nest fixture subset.

Dependencies are pinned in `package-lock.json`. External URL availability is
not part of the deterministic local checks.

Case definitions contain expectations, not execution results. Execution evidence
belongs in separate reports tied to case IDs and the implementation revision.
YAML parsing does not establish ActQL semantic validity. The MoonBit checker and
runtime must verify these same fixtures as implementation becomes available.

## Updating specification metadata

For normative edits, preserve or explicitly assign `requirement-block` IDs.
Run `npm run check:metadata` to inspect added, changed and removed obligations
and document-import pins, then `npm run update:metadata` to apply reviewed
updates. Changed obligations become pending and do not inherit execution evidence.
Review the Git diff and run `npm run check:docs` before committing.

`npm run generate:requirements` regenerates only the combined registry from
owner-local records. It does not approve changed statements or produce evidence.

The metadata updater refreshes owner-local records and document references to
machine bodies. It does not rewrite machine contracts, internal registry
identities or external dependency pins. Those require their contract-specific
generation and identity rules; a matching hash alone is not approval.

`npm run generate:nest` regenerates nest expectations from the independent
reference lowering. Review identity preimages and graph changes before accepting
updated goldens; production output is not their source of truth.

## Versioning

Implementation packages start at `0.0.1` and advance through `0.0.x` during
development. The first formal release is `0.1.0`, after the release scope is
implemented and verified under the [conformance requirements](spec/conformance.md).

Language and machine-contract version identifiers remain independent of package
versions. The implementation targets `actql/0.1`; exact contract contents are
pinned by CID. Changing contract contents changes their CID. Package releases
do not rename contracts or imply compatibility between different pins.
Supported profiles and verification evidence are reported separately.

## Implementation materials

Before algebra implementation, resolve the normative bodies referenced by the
AoA contract: kernel, pipeline, scalar and primitive laws, pipeline registry and
target module contract. The portability/operation-semantics contract and bound
transfer laws also need resolvable bodies. CID pins alone are not those bodies.

For each dependency, record its role, exact version and CID, local path or pinned
retrieval location, hash preimage rule and required profiles. Verify the retrieved
body against its pin before using it; do not infer a replacement from an implementation.
The current document checks do not establish this transitive dependency closure.

The Unicode data tables and remaining independent corpora are also implementation
inputs to supply. README operation excerpts need typed fixture contexts before
compiler conformance checks; parsing complete Programs does not validate excerpts.
